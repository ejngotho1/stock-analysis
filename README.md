# STOCK ANALYSIS with EXCEL and VBA

## OVERVIEW: VBA Stock Analysis Project

### Purpose

In this project and analyisis, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data.
Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. 
We will use fewer steps to make sure logic runs faster 

### Analysis and Challenges

- Prepare our dataset `VBA_Challenge.vbs` file for the project.
- Create our resources folder to hold the run-time pop-up messages that we’ll screenshot 
  after running refactored analyses for 2017 and 2018.
- Add the VBA_Challenge.vbs script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.
- In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the 
- data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. 
- Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

## SUMMARY: Our Statement:

### Deliverable with detail analysis
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

- You need to perform code refactoring in small steps. Make tiny changes in your program, 
  each of the small changes makes your code slightly better and leaves the application in 
- a working state.

### Disadvantages

- A long procedure may contain the same line of code in several locations, you can change 
  the logic to eliminate the duplicate lines.
- A logical structure may be duplicated in two or more procedures coding. 
- When detected, this logic is best moved to a new function and called from the other functions.
- A complex unstructured code is usually best to split in several functions. 


### Advantages
- Logical errors easily appear in well structure code that contains nested conditionals 
  and loops. 
- In our case, using Excel flow displays program logic in a more comprehensible manner, 
  not tied to the order that the underlying code is written.
- VBA interpretation (Excel) of code can reveal patterns that are not easy to see in the source.

#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

- Improving or updating the code without changing the software’s functionality or 
  external behavior of the application is known as code refactoring.
